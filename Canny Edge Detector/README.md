This is a demonstration of Canny Edge Detector, which follows through 4 steps to detect edges (areas of varying intensity, as image processing guys call it..)

* Removing noise through Gaussian smoothing

* Calculating magnitude of gradient using Sobel operator and the angle also

* Non-max suppression

* Hysteresis or edge tracking
