# The Expense Manager (with a new style!)

This is the good old Expense manager project but with a different way to insert information. Instead of manually adding every info such as date, month etc., simply enter something like "spent 400 rs on food on 9 apr" or "wasted rs 4000 on 12 march in gambling" and the string will automatically extract the month, day, amount and description and store it in a database.
